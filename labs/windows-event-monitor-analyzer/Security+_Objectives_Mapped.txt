Security+ Objectives Mapping (SY0-701) — Windows Event Monitor & Analyzer

Domain 1 — Threats, Attacks & Vulnerabilities
- 1.2 Compare and contrast types of attacks (e.g., brute force): simulated repeated failed logons (4625).
- 1.5 Analyze indicators associated with attacks (log entries, failed authentication).

Domain 2 — Architecture & Design
- 2.1 Security concepts in enterprise environments: segmented VirtualBox lab network.
- 2.4 Implement secure configurations: enable Windows auditing / Sysmon.

Domain 3 — Implementation
- 3.4 Identity and account management controls: monitor local account logons.
- 3.7 Secure network protocols: inspect RDP/SMB traffic with Wireshark.

Domain 4 — Operations & Incident Response
- 4.1 Use tools to assess security: Wireshark, log analysis, custom Python script.
- 4.2 Importance of processes for incident response: incident write-up & review.
- 4.3 Apply common data sources: Windows logs + network data correlation.

Domain 5 — Governance, Risk, and Compliance
- 5.5 Documentation and evidence in incident response: screenshots, triage report.
